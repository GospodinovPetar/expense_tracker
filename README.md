   # or on Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations

# Admin Panel

Django comes with a built-in **Admin Panel** that allows you to manage and interact with your application's data easily. You can use the Admin Panel to view and edit your expenses, incomes, and other models directly from a web interface.

### Step 1: Create a Superuser

In order to access the Admin Panel, you need to create a **superuser** with admin privileges. You can do this by following these steps:

1. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
3. You will be prompted to enter the following details:
- Username: Choose a username (e.g., admin)
- Email address: Provide an email address (e.g., admin@example.com)
- Password: Set a strong password for the superuser account.
Once the superuser is created successfully, you will see a confirmation message.

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the server, and you should see output similar to this:
```bash
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

### Step 3: Access the Admin Panel
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to the following URL:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

You will be prompted to log in using the superuser credentials that you created earlier (username and password).

Once logged in to the Admin Panel, you'll be able to:
- **View and Edit Expenses:** You can add, edit, or delete expenses directly from the admin interface.
- **View and Edit Incomes:** You can manage income records similarly to expenses.
